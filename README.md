# Bubble


This repository demonstrates the implementation of bubble sort algorithm. Bubble sort algorithm:

i) Compare elements from left to right

ii) If the next element is greater than current element then swap positions

iii) Continue until the last element which will push the biggest number to the last index

iv) Repeat the iteration and end at last element - 1
